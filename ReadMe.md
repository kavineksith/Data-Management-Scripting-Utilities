# Data Management Scripts Documentation

## Overview
The Data Management Scripts repository provides a suite of Python tools designed for various data management and processing tasks. This suite encompasses functionalities for handling data uploads, managing databases, previewing CSV files, processing images, replacing domains in email lists, calculating disk storage, generating timestamps, formatting names, processing employee data, validating date ranges, handling data entries, and synchronizing directories. These scripts aim to streamline and automate tasks associated with system monitoring, data processing, and reporting.

## Components
### 1. **Log Analyzer Script**
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes log files to filter and extract entries based on log levels and search parameters.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Filters log entries by `ERROR`, `INFO`, or `WARN` levels.
     - Searches for specified terms within the filtered log entries.
     - Exports the filtered log data to a new file.

### 2. **DataUploader Class**
   - **Purpose**: Uploads data from a source file to an export file.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Checks the existence of source and export files before proceeding.
     - Handles data upload and management tasks.

### 3. **DatabaseManager Class**
   - **Purpose**: Manages SQLite database operations.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Handles database creation, data insertion, and connection management.
     - Processes CSV files to insert data into the database.

### 4. **CSVPreviewer Class**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a preview of CSV file content.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Reads and displays the CSV file's content in a formatted manner.
     - Provides information on the total number of lines processed.

### 5. **ImageProcessor Class**
   - **Purpose**: Processes images within a specified directory.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Resizes, rotates, and converts images to different formats.
     - Handles exceptions related to file access and image processing.

### 6. **DomainReplacer Class**
   - **Purpose**: Replaces old domain names in a list of email addresses.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Processes source files, performs domain replacement, and writes the modified data to an export file.

### 7. **DiskStorageCalculator Class**
   - **Purpose**: Calculates the total size of disk storage.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Computes storage size based on input parameters (cylinders, heads, sectors per track, bytes per sector).
     - Provides the total size in gigabytes and ensures numeric input values.

### 8. **TimeStampGenerator Class**
   - **Purpose**: Generates timestamps for time and date.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Provides timestamps in the format HH:MM:SS for time and DD/MM/YYYY for date.
     - Includes a method for generating a timestamp report.

### 9. **CSVPreviewer Class (Second Implementation)**
   - **Purpose**: Alternative implementation of the CSV previewing functionality.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Formats and displays CSV data with improved readability.

### 10. **NameFormatter Class**
   - **Purpose**: Formats names by rearranging first and last names.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Rearranges names from `firstname lastname` format to `lastname firstname`.

### 11. **EmployeeDataProcessor Class**
   - **Purpose**: Processes employee data from a CSV file and generates a JSON report.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Reads employee data from a CSV file.
     - Processes the data to count the number of employees in each department.
     - Saves the processed data to a JSON file.

### 12. **DateRangeValidator Class**
   - **Purpose**: Validates and manages date ranges for processing employee data.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Parses and validates date ranges in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
     - Ensures the start date is not after the end date.

### 13. **EmployeeDataProcessor Class (Extended)**
   - **Purpose**: Processes employee data and filters employees based on a date range.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Reads employee data from a CSV file.
     - Filters and lists employees whose start dates fall within the specified range.

### 14. **DataHandler Class**
   - **Purpose**: Manages and processes data entries from a CSV file.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Loads data from a CSV file into an internal dictionary.
     - Finds data entries based on provided first and last names.

### 15. **DataSyncManager Class**
   - **Purpose**: Synchronizes directories using `rsync` for data backup and transfer.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Executes the `rsync` command to sync data from a source directory to a destination directory.
     - Handles exceptions related to `rsync` execution, file permissions, and command availability.
   - **Exception Handling**:
     - Manages errors from `rsync` process failures, permission issues, missing commands, and user interruptions.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**: Required for running the scripts.
- **Standard Libraries**: `os`, `sys`, `csv`, `sqlite3`, `re`, `json`, `datetime`, `multiprocessing`, `subprocess`
- **Third-Party Libraries**: 
  - **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing tasks.

## Usage
**Log Analyzer**, **DataUploader, DatabaseManager, CSVPreviewer, ImageProcessor, DomainReplacer, DiskStorageCalculator, TimeStampGenerator, CSVPreviewer (Second Implementation), NameFormatter**, **EmployeeDataProcessor**, **DateRangeValidator**, **EmployeeDataProcessor(Extended)**, **DataHandler**, **DataSyncManager**:
   - Execute each script using Python 3.x as instructed within the respective script's comments or documentation.
   - Provide necessary input files, directories, or parameters as required by each script's functionality.
